# Handle CA certificate
# The original Dockerfile copied ca-certificate.crt from the project root to /ssl/ca-certificate.crt.
# Your app/ directory also contains a ca-certificate.crt, which will be copied to /app/ca-certificate.crt
# by the COPY --from=builder /app /app line.
# You need to ensure your application is configured to use the correct certificate.
# If it's supposed to use the one from the project root, placed in /ssl/:
COPY ca-certificate.crt /ssl/ca-certificate.crt
# If your app reads it from its own directory (e.g., /app/ca-certificate.crt), that's already handled.
